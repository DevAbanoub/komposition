# Rendering

When you have finished edited and are happy with your project, it's time to
render. Press the <kbd>r</kbd> button on your keyboard, or click the "Render"
button under the "Project" top menu. A file selector will open, in which you
decide where the rendered file should be saved and what file name it should
have.

The rendering can take some time, so this is a good time to get that second
cup of coffee or tea.
