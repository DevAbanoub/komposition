# Undo & Redo

Timeline commands and asset imports can be *undone* and *redone* in
Komposition. Press the <kbd>u</kbd> key to undo the last command,
and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> to redo the last undone
command.

The undo and redo information is part of saved projects, meaning that
you can undo actions even after you've exited Komposition and reopened
the project at a later time.
