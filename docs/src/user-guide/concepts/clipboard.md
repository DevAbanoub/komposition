# Clipboard

The clipboard is used for copying and pasting in the timeline. It can
hold a single timeline part, i.e. a sequence, parallel, video part, or
audio part.

To copy the focused part of the timeline to the clipboard, press the
<kbd>y</kbd> key. To paste the part stored in the clipboard, press the
<kbd>p<kbd> key. This adds the clipboard part *after* your currently
focused timeline part. If you want to add it *before*, use the
uppercase <kbd>P<kbd> version of paste.

Like in Vim, deleting something from the timeline also puts the
deleted part in the clipboard. Mainstream software call this operation
_cutting_. This is useful if you want to move something from one place
to another, without making any intermediate copies.
