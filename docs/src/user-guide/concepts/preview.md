# Preview

When you're working with your timeline, adding clips and gaps, arranging them
in sequences and parallels, you may want to preview the rendered result. Doing
a full [render](rendering.md) can take some time, so instead you should use
the preview functionality.

When focusing a sequence or a parallel, press the space bar on your keyboard
to open a preview player. You can cancel the preview at any point by pressing
the escape key, or by closing the window with your mouse.
