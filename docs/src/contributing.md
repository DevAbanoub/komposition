# Contributing

Komposition is an early-stage software project. You should expect some rough
edges. If you find a bug, or a place where documentation could be better,
please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/owickstrom/komposition).

If you want to help develop Komposition, look around the reported issues on
Github if there's anything you can pick up. However, as this is a highly
opinionated piece of software, discussion prior to any change is highly
encouraged. It would be very sad to reject your pull request becuase it
hasn't been properly planned beforehand.
