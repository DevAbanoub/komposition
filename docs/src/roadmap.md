# Roadmap

Komposition 0.1.0 has just been released. Although it's very exciting,
Komposition is lacking some big features. For coming releases, we're hoping
to include a lot of those features.

Have a look at the [0.2.0
milestone](https://github.com/owickstrom/komposition/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.2.0)
on GitHub to see what's planned.

If you have any other suggestions, or want to help with these features,
please head over to the [Gitter
room](https://gitter.im/owickstrom/komposition) to discuss them.
