# Contributing

Komposition is an early-stage software project. You should expect
some rough edges. If you find a bug, or a place where documentation
could be better, please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/owickstrom/komposition/issues/new/choose).

If you want to help develop Komposition, look around the reported 
issues on Github if there's anything you can pick up. Issues are
labelled to make them easier to find, and you might interested in the
following tags if you want to help out:

- [Good first issue](https://github.com/owickstrom/komposition/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
- [Help wanted](https://github.com/owickstrom/komposition/labels/help%20wanted)

However, as this is a highly opinionated piece of software, discussion
prior to any change is highly encouraged. It would be very sad to reject
your pull request becuase it hasn't been properly planned beforehand.
